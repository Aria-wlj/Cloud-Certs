  -  a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources
- **Compute optimized instances**
  -  for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance **processors**
  - e.g. web, application, and gaming servers
- **Memory optimized instances**
  - fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory
- **Accelerated computing instances**
  - use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs
- **Storage optimized instances**
  - for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage
  - e.g. distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems

### EC2 Pricing

|                                  |                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| On-Demand                        | - No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. - For short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. - **Less than 1 year** |
| **Reserved Instances**           | a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances. - a commitment of either **1 year or 3 years** |
| - Standard Reserved Instances    | - If knowing the choice of instance type & size & AWS Region |
| - Convertible Reserved Instances | - If runs in different Zones / instance types                |
| EC2 Instance Saving Plans        | - when you make an **hourly spend commitment** to an instance family and Region for a **1-year or 3-year term**. -  if you need flexibility in your Amazon EC2 usage over the duration of the commitment term - save of up to 72% over On-Demand costs |
| Spot Instance                    | - ideal for workloads with **flexible start and end times**, or can **withstand interruptions**. - processing job that can start and stop as needed without affecting overall operations |
| Dedicated Hosts                  | -  physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use. - for who owns per-core **software / SQL licenses** |

##### !!

**Standard Reserved Instances typically provide the highest discount levels**. One-year Standard Reserved Instances provide a similar discount to three-year Convertible Reserved Instances.

##### Dedicated __

A Dedicated Host gives you additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server, and you can consistently deploy your instances to the same physical server over time.

With dedicated hosts, you can use your existing Microsoft SQL Server licenses on Amazon EC2 instances. This allows you to bring your existing licenses and use them on EC2 instances, rather than purchasing new licenses

# Security

### AWS Shared Responsibility Model

![sharedResponsibilityModel](CLFC02.assets/sharedResponsibilityModel.png)

**Customers** are responsible for the security of everything that they create and put *in* the AWS Cloud.

**AWS** is responsible for security *of* the cloud. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components at all layers of infrastructure. 

##### Shared controls: 

- **Patch Management** - in the infrastructure; in guest OS and applications (including EC2 instances)
- **Configuration Management** - infrastructure devices; guest OS, database, applications
- **Awareness & Training** - each one's employee

##### !!!

It's **customers**' responsibility to 

- patch EC2 instances
- to updating the **guest OS** on EC2 instances
- Apply encryption options for the database (when using Amazon RDS
- managing their **data**
- using IAM tools

**AWS** responsibility: 

- Installing the database engine when a workload is running in Amazon RDS; 
- Installing OS on EC2 instanc



### AWS IAM

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- enables you to **manage access** to AWS **services and resources** securely
- You can apply IAM policies to IAM users, groups, or roles. You cannot apply an IAM policy to the AWS account root user.
- IAM supports multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Always **no charge**. 

#### IAM credential report

provides details about the IAM users in an AWS account, including their **access keys, passwords, MFA devices**, and various other security-related information. 

However, the report does ***not*** include information such as the type of MFA device assigned to an IAM user, the User-Agent browser identifier for each logged-in IAM user, or the number of incorrect login attempts.

#### **AWS account root user**

has complete access to all the AWS services and resources in the account

- Follow the security principle of **least privilege** when granting permissions: prevent users or roles from having more permissions than needed to perform their tasks.
- Only the AWS account root user has the permissions to 
  - change AWS Support plan
  - close an AWS account
- Only AWS account owner can 
  - create and manage **access keys** for the AWS account. 


##### Access key

not use the root user access keys for everyday access to AWS services and to instead create IAM users with only the necessary permissions.  Avoid sharing the root user access keys. The best practice is to delete the keys and create IAM users with appropriate permissions.

#### **IAM users**

consists of a name and credentials

##### IAM user Password changing 

If users have been granted permission to change their own IAM user password, you can **use AWS CLI / AWS API / AWS Management Console.** 

#### **IAM policies**

a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources

#### **IAM groups**

a **collection of IAM users**, all users in the group are granted permissions specified by the policy.

#### **IAM roles**

An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to gain **temporary access** to permissions.  

AWS security best practices recommend **using IAM roles to grant permissions to AWS resources**, including S3 buckets. 

By **attaching IAM roles to EC2 instance**, make it get access to the required AWS resources. 

#### **Multi-factor authentication**

provides an extra layer of security for your AWS account

##### IAM users v.s. IAM roles

Users -give ability to people: creates AWS access credentials for individuals; add users to IAM groups

Roles - grant access to resources/service/account:  an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances requires access to other AWS services; the company creates an application that runs on a mobile phone that makes requests to AWS

##### IAM cannot

1. cannot limit the access to AWS service for member accounts, SCPs can
2. cannot see if the security group was changed, AWS CloudTrail can





### **AWS Organizations**

  - automatically protects all AWS customers at no cost. It protects your AWS resources from the most common, frequently occurring types of DDoS attacks. 
  - a paid service that provides detailed attack diagnostics and the ability to detect and mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks. 



### Additional Security Services

#### **AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)**

enables you to perform **encryption** operations through the use of **cryptographic keys**

#### **AWS WAF**

**Web Application Firewall** that lets you **monitor network requests** that come into your **web applications**. 

works in a similar way to block or allow traffic. However, it does this **by using a web access control list (ACL)**

You can also use AWS WAF to block or allow requests based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or **values in the requests**. 

- FOR: 
  - **sql injection** attacks
  - cross-site scripting
- can be used by the services:
