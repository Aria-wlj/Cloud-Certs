is the customer side of a VPN connection, is one of the **components of an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection**

##### Virtual private gateway (VGW)

establish a **virtual private network (VPN) connection** **between your VPC and a private network**,

- **connect to your VPC with a VPN connection** needs two components: a virtual private gateway on the VPC side and a customer gateway on the on-premise network side.

#### Internet gateway

A component of VPC, being attached to the VPC, is a connection **between a VPC and the internet**. 

Enables Internet communications for instances in public subnets

#### VPC Peering

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection **between two VPCs** that enables you to route traffic between them

- e.g.  if you have more than one AWS account, you can peer the VPCs across those accounts to create a file sharing network. You can also use a VPC peering connection to allow other VPCs to access resources you have in one of your VPCs.

#### VPC endpoint 

enable private connectivity to services hosted in AWS, from within your VPC **without using an Internet Gateway**, VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies.

##### Gateway endpoints

Gateway VPC endpoints provide reliable connectivity to **Amazon S3 and DynamoDB** **without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device** for your VPC. Gateway endpoints do not use AWS PrivateLink, unlike other types of VPC endpoints.

#### AWS  PrivateLink

provides direct secure connections **from VPCs to other AWS services**.

#### AWS Transit Gateway

[AWS Transit Gateway]: https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/

**Connect VPCs and on-premises networks** **through a central hub**. **centrally**

#### Amazon API Gateway

a **fully managed service** that makes it easy for developers to **create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs** at any scale. 

handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls

Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication application. (e.g. publish and manage web services that provide REST APIs)

#### AWS VPN CloudHub

connect from your on-premise data center to a VPC

If you have multiple VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub.

#### AWS managed VPN

can be used to quickly connect from an **office** to an Amazon VPC.

- uses the public internet, not a dedicated link, performance is **not consistent**.



#### Management

##### AWS VPC management console

can configure subnets, Security Groups, and endpoints within the VPC section of AWS management console



### Subnets

is **a section of VPC** that can contain resources that being grouped 



### Network Access Control list (ACL)

a **virtual firewall** that controls inbound and outbound traffic **at the subnet level**.

is a **Stateless packet filtering**, which remember nothing 

They process rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, when deciding whether to allow traffic.



### Security Group

a **virtual firewall** that controls inbound and outbound traffic **for an Amazon EC2 instance**.

By default, a security group **denies all** inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic.  

is a **Stateful packet filtering**, remember previous decisions made for incoming packets



#### ACL vs. Security Group

# Storage and Databases

You can store files on the Elastic Block Store (EBS), and Elastic File System (EFS). 

##### Gateway Virtual Tape Library

is used to **backup** data **with popular backup software** such as NetBackup, Backup Exec and Veeam. Uses a virtual media changer and tape drives.

##### Redshift vs. RDS

RDS is a transactional DB, Redshift is an analytics DB

### Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

a service that provides **block-level** storage **volumes** that you can **attach to an Amazon EC2 instances**. / can be used to provide root storage volumes for Amazon EC2 instances / like a **virtual hard disk**

Stores data **in a single Availability Zone**. 

Best for **data that requires retention**: by creating Amazon EBS snapshots, **retention** can be realized. 

EBS volumes must be **in the same AZ as the instances** they are attached to

##### encryption

Amazon EBS encryption offers a straight-forward encryption solution for your EBS resources that doesn't require you to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure.

Both non-root and root volumes can be encrypted

##### Charge

- charged for the amount of data provisioned (not consumed) per month
- charged for the amount you provision in IOPS
- the storage consumed by snapshots

#### **Amazon EBS snapshots**

an incremental backup (the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data. For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved. )

- can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes **to Amazon S3** by taking point-in-time snapshots.

### Instance stores

**Block-level** storage **volumes** behave like physical hard drives.

disk storage that is **physically attached to the host computer** for an EC2 instance, provides **temporary block-level storage** for an Amazon EC2 instance. 

Data is deleted when an EC2 instance is stopped



### Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

is a service that provides **object-level** storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in **buckets**.

- offers virtually **unlimited storage**.
- **scale automatically**
- **consists of buckets** (root level **folders**) and **objects** (the files, images). 
  - Buckets is the top-level container used to hold objects
  - can using folders to mimic hierarchical structure since it is a flat structure
- can be used to 
  - **host static websites** to deliver HTML, JavaScript, images, and video for sites that do not contain server-side scripting.
  - **backup and restore**, data lakes and archival solutions
  - application hosting, media hosting, software delivery
- use a REST API over HTTPS to **access** objects in an object store

#### S3 bucket

All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket are **automatically encrypted** at rest.

- bucket names must be **unique globally**, since Amazon S3 uses a universal (global) namespace
- Objects within a bucket are replicated within a region across multiple AZs (except for the One-Zone IA class).

##### S3 bucket policy

- **Resource** - common Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
- **Principal** - specifies the user, account, service, or other entity that is allowed or denied access to a resource
- **Actions** - defines a set of permissions that you can specify in a policy.

#### Tag the objects in the S3 bucket

- Object tags enable **fine-grained access control of permissions**. 
  - (e.g. A user is storing objects in Amazon S3. The user needs to <u>restrict access to the objects</u> to meet compliance obligations.)
- Use object tagging to categorize storage
- Using cost allocation S3 bucket tags to track the storage cost or other criteria for individual projects or groups of projects

#### Object storage

In **object storage**, each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.

#### Amazon S3 classes

- **S3 Standard**

  pay: a per GB/month storage fee, and data transfer out of S3

  - frequently accessed data
  - Stores data in **a minimum of three** Availability Zones
  - cost **higher** than other storage classes intended for infrequently accessed data and archival storage.
- **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access**
  - for infrequently accessed data but requires **high availability** when needed
  - store data in **a minimum of three** Availability Zones
  - has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price
- **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access**
  
  - Stores data in a single Availability Zone
  - intended for use cases with infrequently accessed data that is **re-creatable**
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**
  - Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
  - Requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
  - Amazon S3 **monitors objects’ access patterns**
    - IF no access for 30 days, be automated moved to **S3-Standard IA**
    - IF access, moved to **S3 Standard**
- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**

  - Works well for archived data that requires **immediate access** (within a few milliseconds, the same performance as S3 Standard)
- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**
  - **Low-cost storage** designed for data archiving
  - retrieve objects **from 1 minute to 12 hours**
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**
  - **Lowest-cost storage** class ideal for archiving
  - retrieve objects within **12 hours**, data retrieval from **12 to 48 hours**
  - stored across at **least three** geographically dispersed Availability Zones
  - retain data sets for 7-10 years and longer
- **S3 Outposts**
  - Creates **S3 buckets** on Amazon S3 Outposts
  - Makes it easier to retrieve, store, and access data **on AWS Outposts**
    - delivers object storage **to your on-premises** AWS Outposts environment
    - store data durably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on your Outposts
    - works well for workloads with local data residency requirements that must satisfy demanding performance needs by keeping data close to on-premises applications.

**Availability: S3 Standard = S3 Standard-IA = S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**

**storage price: S3 Glacier Deep Archive < S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval < S3 One Zone-IA < S3 Standard**

##### Move between tiers

In the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, Amazon S3 moves objects between a frequent access tier and an infrequent access tier. 

If an object has not accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier, S3 Standard-IA. If an object is accessed in the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the frequent access tier, S3 Standard.

##### Fee for S3

With the standard storage class you pay a per GB/month storage fee, and data transfer out of S3. 

Standard-IA and One Zone-IA have a minimum capacity charge per object. 

Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, and Glacier also have a retrieval fee. You don’t pay for data into S3 under any storage class.

#### Access Analyzer for S3

IAM Access Analyzer for S3 provides findings for buckets that can be accessed outside your AWS account. (e.g. user can review all Amazon S3 buckets with ACLs and S3 bucket policies in the S3 console)



#### AWS Storage Gateway

AWS Storage Gateway is a set of **hybrid cloud storage** services that **provide on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access.**.

- support **encryption**

- AWS Storage Gateway supports **three** storage interfaces: **file, volume, and tape**

by caching frequently accessed data locally for **low-latency access** while **asynchronously backing up** data to Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier for durable, off-site storage

- e.g. needs to extend the tape library's capacity to the AWS Cloud

#### Amazon S3 File Gateway

provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud in order to **store** **application data** files and **backup** images as durable objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage

offers SMB or **NFS-based**(Network File System) access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching. It can be used for on-premises data-intensive Amazon EC2-based applications that need file protocol access to S3 object storage.





#### S3 details



##### s3 cross-region replication

enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions. Buckets configured for cross-region replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different account

to protect from a regional disaster: to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different AWS Regions

1. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. 
2. You can copy objects between different AWS Regions or within the same Region. 
3. Both source and destination buckets must have **versioning enabled**. 
4. The source bucket owner must have the source and destination AWS Regions **enabled** for their account. 
5. The destination bucket owner must have the destination Region-enabled for their account.

##### Amazon S3 Lifecycle rules / Object Lifecycle Management

a set of rules that you can create to **automate the transition of objects between different storage classes** or deletion when objects are no longer needed. This can help you to save money on storage costs and to manage your data more effectively.

##### Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration 

enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and your Amazon S3 bucket.

##### AWS Glacier data access option

- Expedited - retrieves data from an archive in 1-5 minutes

### AWS IAM

#### **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- enables you to **manage access** to AWS **services and resources** securely across **all regions**, is a global service
- You can **apply IAM policies** to IAM users, groups, or roles. You cannot apply an IAM policy to the AWS account root user.
- IAM supports multi-factor authentication (**MFA**)
- can be managed through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Tools, AWS SDKs, and IAM HTTPS API.

Always **no charge**. 

##### IAM credential report

provides details about the IAM users in an AWS account, including their **access keys, passwords, MFA devices**, and various other security-related information. 

- The date and time when an IAM user's password was last used to sign in to the AWS Management Console.
- Whether multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been enabled for an IAM user.

audit its password and access key **rotation details** for compliance purposes

However, the report does ***not*** include information such as the type of MFA device assigned to an IAM user, the User-Agent browser identifier for each logged-in IAM user, or the number of incorrect login attempts.

##### AWS IAM Access Analyzer

helps you **identify** the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, shared with an **external entity**. It automatically **reviews policies** and **provides actionable recommendations** for securing access to AWS resources.

To **identify unintended access** to your resources and data, which is a security risk.. 

##### access advisor

The IAM console provides information of **service last accessed data** about when IAM users and roles last attempted to access AWS services, help you identify **unnecessary permissions**



#### **AWS account root user**

has complete access to all the AWS services and resources in the account

- Follow the security principle of **least privilege** when granting permissions: prevent users or roles from having more permissions than needed to perform their tasks.
- It is highly recommended to enable MFA for root user account
- Root user account permissions cannot be restricted,
- It's a **best practice** to **not use the root user access keys** for everyday access to AWS services and to instead create IAM users with only the necessary permissions. The best practice is to **delete the keys** and create IAM users with appropriate permissions.
- Only root user has the permissions to : 
  - change AWS Support plan
  - Changing the account name; close an AWS account
- Only AWS account owner can 
  - create and manage **access keys** for the AWS account. 

##### Access key

**programmatic** **access** to AWS resources through the AWS **CLI** or the AWS **API**, is used to make programmatic calls to AWS using the API

consist of two parts: an acess key ID & a secret access key

- not use the root user access keys for everyday access to AWS services and to instead create IAM users with only the necessary permissions.
- Avoid sharing the root user access keys.
- The best practice is to delete the keys and create IAM users with appropriate permissions.



##### **IAM users**

consists of a name and credentials

can be assigned :

- an access key ID and secret access key
- A password for access to the management console

##### IAM user Password changing 

If users have been granted permission to change their own IAM user password, you can **use AWS CLI / AWS API / AWS Management Console.** 

##### **IAM policies**

a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources

elements include: 

1. Version
2. Statement
   1. Sid; Effect; Principal; Action; Resource; Condition

##### **IAM groups**

a **collection of IAM users**, all users in the group are granted permissions specified by the policy.

- A user can be a member of multiple groups
- Groups can contain users only and **cannot be nested**

##### **IAM roles**

An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to gain **temporary access** to permissions.  

AWS security best practices recommend **using IAM roles to grant permissions to AWS resources**, including S3 buckets. 

- By **attaching IAM roles to EC2 instance**, make it get access to the required AWS resources. 
- Using IAM roles instead of storing credentials within EC2 instances is more secure It is also easier to manage roles.

##### IAM users v.s. IAM roles

Users -give ability to people: creates AWS access credentials for individuals; add users to IAM groups

Roles - grant access to resources/service/account:  an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances requires access to other AWS services; the company creates an application that runs on a mobile phone that makes requests to AWS

##### IAM cannot

1. cannot limit the access to AWS service for member accounts, SCPs can
2. cannot see if the security group was changed, AWS CloudTrail can

##### Access

|          | Accessed using                      |      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ---- |
| IAM User | access key ID and secret access key |      |
| CLI/API  | access key ID and secret access key |      |
|          |                                     |      |

##### AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS)

a way to grant **temporary**, limited-privilege credentials to users, applications, or services.

##### 

#### **Multi-factor authentication**

provides an extra layer of security for your AWS account

Steps to enable MFA on an account: 

- Acquire an MFA-compatible device.
- Activate the MFA device in the IAM console or by using the AWS CLI.



#### Best Practice

Don’t share the root user credentials

Enable MFA

Lock away the AWS root user access keys

create individual IAM users rather than sharing IAM user accounts.

- access keys
  - Don’t generate an access key for the root account user
  - Where possible, use IAM roles with temporary security credentials



### **AWS Organizations**

**consolidate and manage** multiple AWS **accounts** within a central location, centrally **control permissions (API actions)** for the accounts in your organization by using **SCPs (service control policies)**, use **tag policies** help you standardize tags across resources in your organization's accounts.

- centrally manage and govern its AWS Cloud environment
- automate the creation of AWS accounts
- simplify billing processes, **consolidated** billing capabilities and payment for multiple AWS accounts

allows users to create new AWS accounts, group multiple accounts to organize workflows, and apply policies to groups of accounts

#### SCPs (Service Control Policies)

Can be applied to control policies **to the organization root**, an individual member account, or an OU. 

Can **restrict the use of specific AWS services** or to impose additional conditions or requirements on the use of those services. / enable you to **place restrictions on the AWS services**

#### **Organizational units**

group accounts into organizational units (OUs) to make it easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements, the member account does not pay for any usage.



#### Pay

The owner of the master account pays for all usage across accounts.
