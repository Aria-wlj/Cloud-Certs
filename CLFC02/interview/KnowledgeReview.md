## My course

### Cloud

- Docker? 

  Docker: a container image that is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

- K8s?

  K8s: provides automating deployment, scaling and management of containerised applications across multiple hosts.

  Docker lets you put everything you need to run your application into a box that can be stored and opened when and where it is required. Once you start boxing up your applications, you need a way to manage them; and that's what Kubernetes does.

  

### Network







## Experience

### Intern

- The platform's primary objective was to generate comprehensive financial reports for the company.
- I clarified intricate business logic and data requirements by **engaging in direct communication with clients**.
- To **enhance the presentation of data insights**, I adeptly crafted documents and fine-tuned Excel files.
- Implementing Azure, I optimized data storage efficiency, significantly enhancing database management capabilities and improved accessibility.



### Network Server

Implemented a server for efficiently file transmission according to the TCP/IP protocol, made it reliable by implementing functions like packet integrity check retransmission. Enhanced network connectivity and data routing, implemented a global switch system.



### Load Balancer

#### Process:

Sending packets to different destinations by modifying destination IP address in the packets.

1. pre-defined the Mininet topology with several clients, servers, and a switch

2. Once a new client connected to the switch, a ARP (

   Address Resolution Protocol

   ) packet will be transmitted to the controller by the switch

   1. A new flow rule is updated in the switch



### SDN application load balancer

SDN: software-defined network

ONOS: Open Network Operating System, an open SDN controller with diverse subsystems

Using ONOS as the control plane, Mininet as the data plane in SDN

OpenFlow is a communication protocol between controllers and switches. By sending OpenFlow messages, controllers can achieve the role of controlling to update the flow tables inside the switches and consequently, decide the output port of packets.



### Cloud Application

- Used microservice architecture for better running
- Used docker-compose for better deployment
