## Customer service



#### What’s One Time You Worked With a Difficult Customer and How Did You Resolve the Situation?

When I worked at a restaurant, there was a situation where a customer became upset due to a billing error on their check. The customer was visibly frustrated and demanded immediate resolution. 

As a waitress, I approached the customer calmly, acknowledging their concerns, and apologized for the mistake. I actively listened to understand the problem, reviewed the bill. To resolve it, I informed the customer that I would quickly consult with the restaurant's manager to rectify the error.

Upon consulting with the manager, I explained the situation, we adjusted the bill to accurately reflect the customer's order. I returned to the customer, communicated the resolution, and offered a sincere apology along with a discount on their meal. Ultimately, the customer appreciated the prompt resolution and left satisfied, even thanking me for addressing the issue professionally.

This experience taught me the importance of remaining calm under pressure, active listening, and swift problem-solving – skills that are directly transferable to IT support. In IT, similar to the restaurant scenario, patience, effective communication, and a focus on resolution are key when dealing with frustrated clients or users experiencing technical issues.



#### Task priority is important, imagine you got two tasks at the same time, one is the customer's Bluetooth doesn't work, another one is the customer's WIFI doesn't work. How will you organize the priorities of them? 

Prioritizing based on the impact and urgency of the issues, I'd consider the WiFi problem as a higher priority in this scenario. Since from my life experience, I think WiFi connectivity is fundamental for device functionality, it affects the customer's working and service. Meanwhile, the Bluetooth issue, while important, tends to be more device-specific and might not hinder essential functions immediately. Hence, I'd address the WiFi problem first to ensure the customer's primary connectivity is restored swiftly, then promptly proceed to resolve the Bluetooth issue, ensuring both concerns are adequately addressed.



#### Say you were asked to do a project involving technology you’d never used before. Where would you start? Walk me through your process.

I will begin by researching this technology through internal resources and online resources, get a foundational understanding of its capabilities and applications. 

Then I will define the project scope by identifying goals, technical requirements, and potential challenges. Create a detailed plan outlining timelines, resource allocation, and risk assessment. 

Training is also needed, so I will apply theoretical knowledge practically. Encourage team involvement in this learning process to deepen understanding. 

In the adapting, seeking solutions and collaborating with experts, and adjusting plans as needed. Maintain open communication channels for feedback and refinement.



#### Imagine I’m a total novice at IT. How would you explain the difference between hardware and software to me?

(I will use simple words and common language, avoid using any technology terminologies. )









## My specific

#### I can see you are not a citizen or permanent resident, does it mean you cannot stay at our company for a long term?

I can and I will stay for a long term. My current visa is after study working visa, which will not be expired in 5 years. And I will probably get a permanent resident within this 5 years because I'm now put my effort on it. For example, I'm now doing the PY program, which will be helpful for immigration. Also, for earning more score in EOI, I've got the highest level score of PTE. So I'm confident that I will be a permanent resident after 5 years. 



#### There are many slang in Australia working place, will that affect your understanding and your work?
