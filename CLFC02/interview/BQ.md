During the project at university, tutor introduced a private cloud for demonstrating our developed website. Initially, I felt a little overwhelming as it was a completely new platform for me. However, I took the initiative to start learning it. 

I began by researching this platform through school website and online resources to find some instructions of it. And define the scope by identifying the using goals and requirements, which is mainly about how to connecting to this cloud and uploading the files. 

Then I tried to practice by uploading some files for testing. And ask others to open the URL to check whether the webpage shown correctly.

## Team

#### What makes a good team?

A good team has shared objectives and common goals. 

Also, within the team, all of us have good communicating, which means not only speaking but also listening. 

Being supportive for each other is also important, when others need help, we should give them a hand without hesitate. 

Willing to take on board feedback, constantly analyze my performance, being open to any improvement that can be made. 





#### Do you prefer working alone or with a team?



#### How would you deal with conflict with a co-worker?





#### Can you tell us about a time when you had to work with others and what you enjoyed about working in a team? 

Working in a bustling restaurant provided numerous instances of collaborating within diverse teams. One memorable experience involved a particularly busy evening where our team was short-staffed. Despite the challenges, we pulled together seamlessly to ensure efficient service.

Each team member brought unique strengths and skills to the table. Clear communication and mutual support were pivotal in managing the rush. We divided tasks, assisted each other without hesitation, and maintained a positive attitude throughout. I specifically recall one instance where a colleague and I coordinated effortlessly to manage a sudden surge in orders, covering for each other and ensuring no area was neglected.

What I truly enjoyed about working in such a team was the camaraderie and shared commitment to a common goal. The synergy within the team was invigorating; there was a sense of unity and mutual respect that transcended individual roles. Witnessing how each person's contribution mattered and how we collectively overcame challenges left a profound impact. It taught me the significance of teamwork, adaptability, and the joy of achieving shared objectives together.





# Customer service

#### What’s One Time You Worked With a Difficult Customer and How Did You Resolve the Situation?

When I worked at a restaurant, there was a situation where a customer became upset due to a billing error on their check. The customer was visibly frustrated and demanded immediate resolution. 

As a waitress, I approached the customer calmly, acknowledging their concerns, and apologized for the mistake. I actively listened to understand the problem, reviewed the bill. To resolve it, I informed the customer that I would quickly consult with the restaurant's manager to rectify the error.

Upon consulting with the manager, I explained the situation, we adjusted the bill. I returned to the customer, communicated the resolution, and offered a sincere apology along with a discount on their meal. Ultimately, the customer appreciated the prompt resolution and left satisfied, even thanking me for addressing the issue professionally.

This experience taught me the importance of remaining calm under pressure, active listening, and swift problem-solving – skills that are directly transferable to IT support. In IT, similar to the restaurant scenario, patience, effective communication, and a focus on resolution are key when dealing with frustrated clients or users experiencing technical issues.



#### Tell me about a time when you provided excellent customer service?











## IT

#### Task priority is important, imagine you got two tasks at the same time, one is the customer's Bluetooth doesn't work, another one is the customer's WIFI doesn't work. How will you organize the priorities of them? 

Prioritizing based on the impact and urgency of the issues. In this scenario, I would consider the WiFi problem as a higher priority. Since from my life experience, I think WiFi connectivity is fundamental for device functionality, it affects the customer's working and service. Meanwhile, the Bluetooth issue, while important, tends to be more device-specific and might not hinder essential functions immediately. Hence, I'd address the WiFi problem first to ensure the customer's connectivity, then promptly proceed to resolve the Bluetooth issue, ensuring both concerns are adequately addressed.



#### Say you were asked to do a project involving technology you’d never used before. Where would you start? Walk me through your process.

I will begin by researching this technology through internal resources and online resources, get a foundational understanding of its capabilities and applications. 

Then I will define the project scope by identifying goals, technical requirements, and potential challenges. Create a detailed plan outlining timelines. 

Training is also needed, so I will apply the theotry into practice to deepen understanding. 

When adapting, always collaborate with experts to seek solutions, and adjusting plans as needed. Always communicate for feedback and refinement.



#### Imagine I’m a total novice at IT. How would you explain the difference between hardware and software to me?

(I will use simple words and common language, avoid using any technology terminologies. )









# My specific

#### I can see you are not a citizen or permanent resident, does it mean you cannot stay at our company for a long term?

I can and I will stay for a long term. My current visa is after study working visa, which will not be expired in 5 years. And I will probably get a permanent resident within this 5 years because I'm now put my effort on it. For example, I'm now doing the PY program, which will be helpful for immigration. Also, for earning more score in EOI, I've got the highest level score of PTE. So I'm confident that I will be a permanent resident after 5 years.
